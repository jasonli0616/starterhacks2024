# StarterHacks 2024
TeamUp! is an application designed to assist users in finding other players who are in close proximity with each other, at similar experience levels in specific sports, in order for users to find partners to play against and with each other, chat with each other, and cooordinate date and times by finding a calendar date that is available for both parties.

Our application can be accessed anywhere through any type of device such as a phone, laptop, or library computer. When a user first logs-in, they will be prompted to create an account using Auth0, and once they have completed their registration, users will be eligible to interact with other communities members in order to find partners to play with and against. The user is able to select their skill and experience level in specific sports that they are interested in finding other players to play with, while reading, posting, and commenting about informational posts regarding all things sports-related.
